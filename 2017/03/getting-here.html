    <h1 class="no-bold">My time at Northeastern</h1>
    <p>
        With my dad being a mechanical engineer and my mom being a chemical engineer, I grew up always wanting to be an engineer and building things. I always wanted to build things and was very math inclined. It wasn't until the summer after my freshman year until I began to figure out that I wanted to do things with computers. I came into northeastern as a mechincal engineering major. My first year courses were all very general engineering and specifially we had an introduction to engineering class. On day we had a class about what co-op was like. Went over a ton of different majors and the y mentioned mechanical egnineering was a ton of solidworks and autocad. I realized that that was not what I wanted to do and switched to electrical engineering. I began doing research through the gordon censiss program. The goal of the research was to use millimeter wave radars to detect wobjects hidden under peoples clothing at a standoff distance. MOst of that work was setting up experiment s and writing simple matlab automatino scripts. Spring of the freshman year I went to a career fair and was quite indimiated. My resume was mostly empty space whereas everyone else has 5pt font. I spoke with as many companies as possible, ending up getting an interview at Textron Systems. I knew almost no programming, just simple matlab and c++. I also took the CS50 class over winter break. I didn't know about algorithms or what a tehcinical interview was. Luckily for me, the interviewer was also a gordon censiss program and I was not asked many difficult questions. I got the job. Over the summer I stayed in boston and continued with the resarch through a SIRF and also interning at Textron. At textron i was given a lot of freedom and worked with neural networks for image recognition. I took a lot of online classes and wrote a neural network in matlab from scratch. This was when I first got interested in working with computers and programming. In the fall I began looking for my first coop and seeing what a techinical interview was. Having the internship freshman year really helped me hear back. I got ended up going to an on campus at apple (more info here). I also went to a ton of hackathons. Over the summer befoer built a rubiks cube robot. d
