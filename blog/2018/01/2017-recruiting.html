        This year, I was on the search for my final co-op at Northeastern. Having to take summer classes due to engineering capstone, I had 6 months free. This meant I could do two internships. 

        My goal for this year was to really push myself and see what I could do. Last year, it was surprisingly difficult to get interviews with just Apple on my resume. This year, with snap dropbox and google I knew I wanted to see what I could do.

        I applied to a ton of places, got many referrals, and reached out to companies i talked to last year. I didn't do much interview prep at all, just a few leetcode questions for a few weeks to get back into it. My interviews ended up turning into the interview preparation. 

        I applied to a lot of financial places, hft hedge funds, prop shops as well as unicorns. Having the things on my resume made my response rate really high. I was able to skip the hackerrank challenge at a few places like quora and stripe. 

        I really wanted to try a financial instituation.

        My recruiting first kicked off in august when i got referrals to jane street, two sigma, and facebook while i was still working at dropbox. Then for the next month as school started it was many phone interviews and hackerrank challenges. This wasnt as bad as I still had much time to be able to dedicate. 

        Once school started, i was starting to do onsites. For my schedule, I only had one class monday wednesday and no classes thursday. And so i traveled and interviews on those days. Over the course of 5 weeks, i had 2 onsites in chicago, 2 in nyc, 2 in sf, and 1 in ct. Most of these werent together which meant i was taking 2 round trip flights a week. This was extremely difficult as I had almost no time for my classes. I had to miss tests and midterms and luckily my professors were understanding in letting me make up.

        Since northeastern doesnt have a policy for dates, it was stressful to get all the timelines to overlap. Although this year I saw that most companies were very flexible. Over the summer i was primarily considering two sigma, bridgewater, drw, and tower. over the winter considering robinhood, citadel, fb. I ended up choosing two sigma due to being able to be in NYC again (loved it the year before) and really enjoying the culture during my itnerview as well as friends of mine really enjoyed working there. I chose robinhood over the winter as I was matched with an extremely cool team and i was able to visit their office during an onsite with a different company. I really enjoyed the smaller environment and people i was able to meet. I knew i could make a large impact with my previous experience and learn a lot. I also a big user of the product and believe in it.

        It was really nice to finish the recuiritng much earlier this year than last year. After the interview season ended i had so much free time. 

        I learned a lot about the interview practices of different companies and I am actually wriitng a diferent blog posts about tips for the internship seach at a non target university.



        As a part of Northeastern's co-op program, I have the opportunity to take 8 months off school for internships/co-op. I was on the hunt for either a long co-op or a few shorter internships starting January 2017. (Info about the co-op program <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/coop/students/overview/">here</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
        The recruiting season kicked off last summer after attending the Greylock Techfair. It's a career fair in the Bay Area that you have to apply and get invited to. Since the number of attendees was limited, it was pretty easy to talk with companies. I also went to Internapalooza but there were way too many eager interns to be useful (though I did get a lifetime supply of T-shirts).
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the Techfair put me in touch with a lot of companies, my technical abilities were definitely not up to par. I spoke with Asana, Airbnb, Coursera, Doordash, Pinterest, and Quora but was unable to get past the interview stage. This was a wake up call for me to study.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being a sheltered CE student a year before, I was blissfully unaware of what Cracking the Coding Interview and Leetcode were. I was never pressured to practice any graph or dynamic programming problems. In order catch up, my classes were placed on the back-burners and I began spending a few hours everyday on Leetcode.
    </p>
    <p>
        By early October, I was feeling a lot more confident in my technical abilities and had interviews set up with Google and Microsoft. I was also in contact with Facebook through an on campus event, Snap through their recruiting event "Snapweek", and Dropbox through a referral from a friend's sister. I applied to ~15 other companies but had not heard back. Northeastern's own co-op recruiting cycle was also beginning to ramp up at this time, putting me in touch with companies local to Boston.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a few weeks, I heard back from both Microsoft and Google with good news. Microsoft gave me 2 weeks to decide whereas I was placed into the abyss that is Google host matching (up to 6 weeks of waiting!). At this time, I was midway through Snap's, Dropbox's, and Facebook's processes and was scheduling onsites/phone interviews. I also had a few onsites with a few Boston startups and a hedge fund.

    </figure>
    <p>
        The day before my Microsoft deadline, I was still waiting (and about to give up on) Google's host matching. I had final interviews lined up for Snap, Facebook, and Dropbox and had a few offers from various companies in Boston. Microsoft was adamant on not extending their deadline so I regrettably turned the offer down.
    </p>
    <p>
        The week after, I was rejected by Facebook. And due to scheduling issues, my final Snap and Dropbox interviews were quite delayed. I continued to double down and turn down expiring offers in hopes of working at a Unicorn.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wasn't stressed for long, as I soon got a call from Google with an interested host and good news from Snap. Both were open to 16 week internships, filling up my 8 months off. I turned down everywhere else with only a Dropbox onsite a few days after.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
        I felt very confident going into my Dropbox interview and soon had all three offers to choose from. I had a 16 week winter offer for Google in Cambridge, a 16 week summer offer for Snap in LA, and a 12 week summer offer for Dropbox in SF or NYC. It was very difficult to choose between as I have always wanted to experience working for Google but am very interested in the product at Snap and Dropbox.
    </p>
    <p>
        And so... I had the crazy idea of doing all three. In order to do so, I needed to shorten Google below their 12 week minimum to 11 weeks. I also needed to shorten Snap to 12 weeks and move the start date from the summer to the middle of spring. This would allow me to work from 1/9 - 9/8 with no breaks in between the 3 internships.
    </p>
    <p>
        The situation was extremely stressful due to the fact that if either Google or Snap were unable to make the changes, I would have to go back on what I said and return to the 16 week internships. Deadlines were approaching and to make matters worse, this was the week before Thanksgiving so responses were slow. All I could do was send some emails and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, two days before Thanksgiving and after a week of worrying, I was given the okay from both Google and Snap. It would be possible for me to work at all three companies in 35 weeks! I immediately signed all 3 offers and was able to fully enjoy my Thanksgiving break.
